// VARIABLE in JAVASCRIPT
// A variable is a container that sotes a value. This is very similar to the container used to store rice,water and oats(Treat this as a analogy).
// The value of javascript variable can be changed during the execution of the program.
// var a  = 67; 
let  a = 67;
// a contains 67
console.log(a);
console.log(typeof(a));
a = "harry";
// now  the type of the varaible changed into 'string' from 'number', in runtime.
console.log(a);
console.log(typeof(a));
// let 6harry = 7;
// Not allowed, this will throw an error
